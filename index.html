<div>American Red Cross Code4Good Project is a first-of-its-kind volunteer workforce that gives software engineers and engineering leaders an opportunity to support the Red Cross Mission by contributing their talents to the development of Redcross.org and Redcrossblood.org platforms.</div>

<div>These valuable platforms represent a gateway for accomplishing several key goals of the Red Cross:</div>

<ul>
<li>Publish life-saving information about the Red Cross, our mission, how we help, how to prepare for natural and unplanned disasters, and more</li>
<li>Solicit financial donations from supportive individuals who generously fund our Mission</li>
<li>Allow blood donors an easy way to schedule a blood donation appointment</li>
<li>Recruit volunteers who are responsible for delivering 90% of our disaster relief hours</li>
<li>Allow professionals and interested individuals to enroll in training and certification courses that help deal with daily emergencies in local communities</li>
 

<div>We operate Code4Good much like any modern distributed software project, with our virtual team collaborating through JIRA, Git, Confluence, Slack, etc.</div>
